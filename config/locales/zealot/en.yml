        body_html: |
          <ol class="mb-0">
            <li>
              In iOS, Apple has designed a signature verification mechanism for apps developed, tested,
              and shelved in order to prevent apps from being distributed in the App Store app store.
              The signature certificate is valid for one year from the date of issuance. After the expiration,
              you need to re-generate and re-sign the app before you can continue to install it.
            </li>
            <li>Tell the developer to go to the Apple developer website to regenerate the signature certificate, build app and upload it.</li>
            <li>Regenerating a signed certificate will not have any effect on the previous application, i. e. once expired it will always be expired, unless re-sign the app.</li>

        title: Why need to install profile to fetch your UDID?
        body_html: |
          <p>
            UDID is an abbreviation for Unique Device Identifier. The UDID is a feature provided by Apple to identify iOS devices.
            Apple uses the UDID to communicate between Apple servers and individual iOS devices. This allows Apple to associate the
            Apple ID and the Cloud ID with the corresponding iOS device. Each iOS device has an unique ID.
          </p>
          <p>
            The UDID of your iOS devices is needed if you want to install alpha and beta iOS apps onto your device before they are released to the official apple store.
          </p>
          <strong>Following the steps:</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Click "Accept" to fetching the profile file.</li>
            <li>Open installed Profile.
              <ol>
                <li>iOS: Open "Setting.app" -> "Downloaded profile" -> "Fetch device's UDID" -> Install.</li>
                <li>macOS: Open the profile named <code>install.mobileconfig</code> then open "System Settings" and click "Profile" in left sidebar menu.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>After install it will open Safari and redirect a result page then delete the profile automatically.</li>
