      As part of restore, the task tried to move existing content from #{path}.
      However, it seems that directory contains files/folders that are not owned.
      To proceed, please move the files or folders inside #{path} to a secure
      location so that #{path} is empty and run restore task again.

      ### NOTICE ###
      As part of restore, the task tried to rename `#{path}` before restoring.
      This could not be completed, perhaps `#{path}` is a mountpoint?

      To complete the restore, please move the contents of `#{path}` to a
      different location and run the restore task again.
